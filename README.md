### Author: Alpesh Chovatiya

### Problem Statement:
Effective inventory and sales management are critical for optimizing profitability in the retail and wholesale industry. Companies need to ensure that they are not incurring losses due to inefficient pricing, poor inventory turnover, or vendor dependency. 
The goal of this analysis is to:
● ​Identify underperforming brands that require promotional or pricing adjustments.
● ​Determine top vendors contributing to sales and gross profit.
● ​Analyze the impact of bulk purchasing on unit costs.
● ​Assess inventory turnover to reduce holding costs and improve efficiency.
● ​Investigate the profitability variance between high-performing and
low-performing vendors.

Bulk purchasing reduces unit cost by about 72%, confirming that larger orders significantly improve cost efficiency.

The company holds $2.71M worth of unsold inventory, representing major tied-up capital and storage expenses.
